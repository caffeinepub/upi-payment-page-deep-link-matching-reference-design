  "summary": "The diff shows PaymentPage.tsx still uses the exact required UPI URI (pa=paytm.s1x87m2@pty, am=99, cu=INR, tn=Verified Merchant Account). The truncated PaymentPage snippet shows no Copy icon import and only a primary pay handler, and the repo’s file summary explicitly states an enlarged “GET PRIMIUM” button, suggesting REQ-6 and REQ-7 were implemented; however, the core part of the component where the buttons/rendering would be confirmed is truncated.",
